Pac-Mania was my final project at Southern Connecticut State University. The foundation of this game is based on Namco's 'Pac-man Battle Royale' arcade. I had already decided that my final project would be an online multi-player web app for my friends to enjoy. Although, I wasn't sure what would be the basis for this application. So after visiting Barcade, I decided that Pac-man would be the basis for this project. However, I didn't want to simply recreate the classic Pac-man game, I wanted to put my own twist and style into the game. My own madness per se. So please enjoy this game of madness, chaos & ghosts frenzy... Pac-Mania.
